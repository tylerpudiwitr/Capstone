      When it comes to actually mixing your track, you have to make sure to stay
      consistent with your work for that's truly the only way to get better. I
      can tell you everything you need to know, but at the end of the day, you
      have to train your ears. It's going to take a lot of trial & error to get
      where you want to be in audio engineering, so make sure you persevere and
      don't be afraid to experiment with different sounds.

      Another thing to remember is that no matter how good you are at mixing
      your track, the most important part of getting the sound you're looking
      for is making sure your raw vocals are recorded properly. You need to be
      confident and try to sound how you want as best as you can without any
      sort of editing. For example, if you want to sound like Kevin Gates but
      have a high-pitched voice, it's going to make it much for difficult to get
      what you're looking for. Another reason to experiment with your sound!
