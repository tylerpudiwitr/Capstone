    When it comes to actually mixing your track, you have to make sure to stay
    consistent with your work for that's truly the only way to get better. I can
    tell you everything you need to know, but at the end of the day, you have to
    train your ears. It's going to take a lot of trial & error to get where you
    want to be in audio engineering, so make sure you persevere and don't be
    afraid to experiment with different sounds.

    Another thing to remember is that no matter how good you are at mixing your
    track, the most important part of getting the sound you're looking for is
    making sure your raw vocals are recorded properly. You need to be confident
    and try to sound how you want as best as you can without any sort of
    editing. For example, if you want to sound like Kevin Gates but have a
    high-pitched voice, it's going to make it much for difficult to get what
    you're looking for. Another reason to experiment with your sound!
